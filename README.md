<p><b>Bigram analysis of "Effie Briest"</b><br>
<br>
This project is part of an NLP course at Universität Würzburg.<br>
The task is to analyze the German novel "Effie Briest" by Theodor Fontane for the occurence of typical bigrams, i.e. word-pairs. For example, the word pair "von Briest" may be expected to occur very often, as this is part of the name of several main personages.<br>
Statistical analysis will follow the work of Dunning in <a href="https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwilmsD7weHXAhVLC-wKHWVoB9IQFggwMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Faclweb.org%2Fanthology%2FJ93-1003&usg=AOvVaw255tnabSLrnqmqx4QJcoKu">"Accurate Methods for the Statistics of Surprise and Coincidence"</a>.<br>
